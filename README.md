# Tappy: A Journey in Game Development
##### By: Edgardo Richard Ventura

### Introduction
Welcome to "Tappy", a 2D game developed during the 'Jumpstart to 2D Game Development: Godot 4 for Beginners' course by Richard Albert on Udemy.
Tappy: A Journey in Game Development

### About the Game
Tappy is a simple yet captivating game where players navigate through various challenges. It's built with Godot 4 and showcases fundamental aspects of game design and development.

### Learning Process
Throughout the development of Tappy, I gained hands-on experience with Godot Engine, learned about game physics, sprite animation, and user interface design. This project has been a cornerstone in understanding the nuances of 2D game development.

### Acknowledgments
A big thank you to Richard Albert for his insightful and comprehensive course on Udemy. His teachings were instrumental in the creation of this game.

### How to Play
1.) Locate the **.zip file** by clicking on the file name, then click on raw or the download icon and you'll have access to the download.
2.) Extracted from th the **.zip file** will contain a folder named **Tappy**, within this folder there are three files that can be used:
  - The **.pck** file is a resorce file that can be opened through godot to do as yo pleasse.
  - There are two applications:
      - The first of which can be played on the **linux** terminal, this one is the 181kb file with the terminal icon on the lower right side of the godot face icon.
      - The second being a windows application, this file is 67,266kb and has the godot icon on its own. This can be played by itself without issue.
3.) Run the project to start the game. To play all you that is required is a space bar. Press space to jump between the pipes and rack up a high score.
